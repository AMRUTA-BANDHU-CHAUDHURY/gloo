  description: >
    Create a local development flow to build all gloo containers in docker, rather than on the local machine, before
    copying the binaries into the containers. This can now be accomplished using some convenience targets in the Makefile.
    For instance: the target for gloo is `gloo-docker-build`. Any of the projects can be built using this pattern,
    `<name>-docker-build`.
